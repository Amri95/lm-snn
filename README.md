# Unsupervised Handwritten Digit Classification using Spiking Neural Networks and Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity

This repository contains the code for the plasticity and learning project in the BINDS
laboratory at UMass Amherst.

Our code is built on Peter Diehl's [research code](https://github.com/peter-u-diehl/stdp-mnist) 
and his work with Matthew Cook at ETH Zurich, from the paper ["Unsupervised learning of digit
recognition using spike-timing-dependent plasticity"](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00099/full#).

We wish to test out more STDP learning rules, speed up the training time (using `brian2`, make 
classification robust with fewer training examples, experiment with the network architecture, 
and try difficult neuron models and parameter settings.
