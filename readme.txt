This repository contains the code for the plasticity and learning project in the BINDS
laboratory at UMass Amherst. It is meant to extend Peter Diehl's code and his work
with Matthew Cook at ETH Zurich, from the paper "Unsupervised learning of digit
recognition using spike-timing-dependent plasticity".

We wish to test out more STDP learning rules, speed up the training time / make
the network classification robust to much fewer training examples, experiment with
the network architecture, and try difficult neuron models and parameter settings
in the simulation.
